# Redis slaves on Spotinst

## Introduction

In this git we will demonstarte how to run Redis cluster slaves on Spotinst using terraform to reduce cloud compute costs up to 80% while leveraging Spotinst Stateful features in order to keep the cluster available.
In Spotinst we devoloped Elasigroup That gives you the option to persist the root and data volume and also the private IP of the instance thus enable to run redis cluster slaves.

## Redis cluster architecture

Redis has 2 main ways of clusters, Sentinal and cluster mode.
We are going to focus on cluster mode, Cluster mode split Redis DB into shards thous every shard holds a portion of the keys by using hash slots.
In Redis there are 16384 hash slots, every key assigned to a hash slot by using the hash function to distribute the keys among the shards.
Every shard (Master) can have a slave replica that can failover from master when he fails, Inorder to failover the cluster has to vote that master isnâ€™t healthy and then the salve will promote to be master.
