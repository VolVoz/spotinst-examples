# Redis slaves on Spotinst

## Introduction

Terraform quickstart to use Redis cluster slaves on Spotinst to reducing cloud compute costs up to 80% while leveraging Spotinst Stateful features in order to keep the cluster available.

## Redis cluster architecture

Redis has 2 main ways of clusters, Sentinal and cluster mode.
We are going to focus on cluster mode, Cluster mode split Redis DB into shards thous every shard holds a portion of the keys by using hash slots.
In Redis there are 16384 hash slots, every key assigned to a hash slot by using the hash function to distribute the keys among the shards.
Every shard (Master) can have a slave replica that can failover from master when he fails, Inorder to failover the cluster has to vote that master isnâ€™t healthy and then the salve will promote to be master.
